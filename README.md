# codelens

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of codelens is to provide tools to inspect and understand new
code bases, to understand how functions interact in a package/analysis,
and how to suggest improvements based on certain patterns, and also how
to help extract a workflow for use in
[targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets). It draws inspiration
from [goodpractice](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice),
[Rclean](https://docs.ropensci.org/Rclean/), and
[CodeDepends](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CodeDepends/vignettes/intro.html)

# early days

The package is still being designed and thought about, so it is still
early days for use.
